    <p>The design I chose was of the word knitting with knitting needles. I chose this design to give as a gift to one of my grandmas, as both of my grandmothers are avid knitters and can use the bag I make to store yarn and knitting needles. The assignment stated this logo is for a hypothetical bussiness, so the design can also serve as a hypothetical bussiness that sells knitting supplies. In all honesty, I thought of the idea before realising that the logo was to be for a bussiness, so I decided that my project could be both, it can be a logo for a knitting bussiness and it could still have a life after the class in the hands of one of my grandmothers.</p>

    <p>To start my design, I chose the text I wanted. I began with the word knitting, choosing a font that was script but still able to be read. I chose and dowloaded the font brushland regular. I then converted the text file to an image. Next, in a new layer, I made the circle on the outside, erasing the places that I did not want visable. I then went in and rounded the edges of the broken circle. Finally, I added in the knitting needles. I imported an image of knitting needles and converted it into a vector file. I then repeated the same process as the circle, I erased the sections I did not want and rounded out the edges. </p>

    <p>Then I was ready to begin using the digital embrodery machine. I chose the fabric from the materials avalible. I chose a plaid fabric because I liked the design and I felt the warm colors fit well with the theme of knitting, as knitting is something that I would associate with being warm. I decided to use a plain white fabric to go with the patterned fabric, as it was the only light colored fabric avalible that went with the other fabric I had chosen. I cut the piece of fabric I was to use and inserted it into the frame. I set up the other equitment on the machine, making sure the current frame and foot is in the machine. I also made sure that the correct color thread was in place and matching bobbin. I chose black thread as I wanted to make sure my design was clear and visable. I uploaded my file into the software premier + and was then able to send it to the machine to stitch. </p>
    <p>In the middle of stitching I got the notification that the bobbin was running low, so I stopped the machine and replaced the bobbin with a new one.</p>

    <p>Lastly I sewed the bag together. I began with creating the tubes for the drawstrings to go into. Next I sewed together the sides of the bag, wrong side to wrong side before flipping it inside out. I repeated this again with sewwing the two panels together into a bag. I used the machine for most of the sewing, however the fabric I chose was quite thick so I did have to hand sew the last few steps. </p>
