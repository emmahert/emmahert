    <p>For my final project, I decided to make a portable earring holder with earrings to go along with it. This is an idea I have been formulating for quite some time. I had wanted to make earrings with the laser cutter since I learned how to use the laser cutter last year and I am happy that now I will able to have the chance to do so. I also have been thinking about incorporating other machines and materials into the earring making proccess, for instance using the 3D printer to make earrings.</p>
    <p>The case is also something that I have been formalizing in my head for quite some time. This case would serve as a travel container for earrings, and potentally other items of jewelry (TBD). At home I have a earring stand that can hold earrings, but this is not functional for traveling. </p>
    <p>I began by sketching out my ideas on paper, as you can see below. Additionally, I looked online for earring design ideas, to see what is possible to create based on what others have already created. Here is where I can across iridescent acylic, which I am concidering for a material.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi1.jpg" alt="Project sketches." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p> Then I began to sketch the earring holder on fusion 360. I created 3 parts for my box, an interior part to hold the earrings, the box part, and a lid. The earring holder has rows of holes to put earrings into, with a space in the middle for earrings to dangle (if they are the dangling sort). There is a hole at the end of the inner part, which a finger can fit into to easily take the inner portion out of the box.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi3.png" alt="fusion 360 design, version 1." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>I also laser cut a piece of wood to test various sizes of holes.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi2.jpg" alt="hole test sizes." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>I then printed out a test of a butterfly image that I designed on a Prusa using PLA. From this test, I have decided that FDM printing will likely work better for this print.</p>

    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi4.jpeg" alt="butterfly earring test." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>I then did a test print of my box design. I printed out each of the three pieces. However, I noticed some adjustments I would have to make to my design for it to be successful. Firstly, I needed to fix the lid, so that it can fit into the box. I also need to make the box taller, to properlly fit the whole earring. Thirdly, I need to make the inner part of the box a bit larger so it can fit a bit more snug into the box. I also need to space apart the earring holes a bit more and increase the larger circle, which functions as a space to pull up the inner part with a finger.</p>

    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi7.jpeg" alt="box test print 1, fit together." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>I then made the aformentioned alternations and reprinted my box.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi8.jpeg" alt="box test print 2." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>However, there still were a few issues with the box. Firstly, the lid fit onto the box, but it did not stay on the box. Secondly, once I began making earrings, I realised that the box was too short and needed to be taller in order to accomidate the size of the earrings. I was able to fix the lid by removing the fillet from the outer portion of the ridge of the lid. I also made the box bigger, which allows earrings to properly fit into the box. This also has the added benifit of creating extra space on the bottom that can be used to store other pieces of jewelry. The design of this version of the box is picture below and the final product is on the bottom of this page, with earrings inside.</p>
    <p>Now I was ready to begin making the earrings. I used a variety of machines and techniques to make a variety of different types of earrings and I assembled the earrings using neddle nose pliers.</p>
    <p> The first earring pictured here is a wooden laser cut stud earring. For this style, super glue was also used to attach the earring to the stud and a clear gloss was applied to the wood for protection.</p>

    <p> The next earring is a clear acrylic laser cut earring with a vinyl cut design.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi10.jpeg" alt="acrylic cut butterfly vinyl earrings." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p> The next two earrings are also cut from clear acrylic as well, however it does not have vinyl cut pieces. The moon earrings also have a laser cut design, creating a different effect.</p>

    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi13.jpeg" alt="box test print 1, fit together." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>Finally, the last earring was sketched then designed using fusion 360 and printed using the FDM printed. The test print using the PLA printed can be seen above.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi11.jpeg" alt="3d printed butterfly wing earrings." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>Lastly, I used the vinyl cutter to create a design for the box, creating a rose pattern for the outside of the box as well as adding the word earrings to the top in a nice font.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi14.jpeg" alt="box test print 1, fit together." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi15.jpeg" alt="box test print 1, fit together." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <img class="image" src="images/final images/fi16.jpeg" alt="box test print 1, fit together." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
  <p> I am happy with how my final product turned out. The only thing that I have not figured out if there is a way to better have the vinyl stick to the PLA, as the pieces are quite small and PLA is not the best material to stick vinyl to. I am however looking forward to wearing my new earrings.</p>
