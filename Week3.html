    <p> This week I used the FDM printer to create a cup/planter. </p>
    <p> To begin, I created the sketch of the print using fusion 360. I began by sketching out the base. The size of the base was chosen to fit into the watercolor holder I created last week.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/week 3 images/w3i8.png" alt="Fusion 360, sketch of base of cup." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p> I then turned the sketch into a 3D structure.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/week 3 images/w3i7.png" alt="Fusion 360, base of cup." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p> Then I used offset planes to build the rest of the sculture. I created a sketch on each of the layers. Then I joined the layers using the loft function, creating a 3D structure.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/week 3 images/w3i6.png" alt="Fusion 360, sketch of sides of the cup." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p> Next a created a repeating pattern. To do this, I began creating a sketch on the vertical axis. Then I use the extrude function to turn the sketch into a 3D object. This was then turned into a pattern using the pattern function, with the pattern type being a circular pattern. Finally, I used shell to make the inside hollow and filleted the edges.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/week 3 images/w3i5.png" alt="Fusion 360, full object." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p> After the object was created, I exported the file as .stl file and opened it in prusa slicer. Here I was able to see how the structure would look like as it printed, layer by layer. Here I also specified details about the print, such as the filiment I used and the location of the print on the print bed. Using prusa slicer I was able to add supports and then I was able to print.</p>
    <p> I exported the file to SD card and then plugged the card into the printer. I did not need to change the filiment, but did take out the excess filiment in the machine from the previous print. I used a glue stick on the print bed to ensure that the first layer adhered properly. Then I chose my file and began my print.</p>

    <p>Finally, once the print was finished, I removed the supports and was able to put my cup into my watercolor holder.</p>
