    <p> This weekâ€™s assignment was to create a type of desk organizer. I decided to create my desk organizer as a watercolor holder.  </p>
    <p>Safety: To ensure safety while using the shaper, I wore eye and ear protection while using the machine. Additionally, I made sure to tie my hair back before using the machine. </p>
    <img class="image" src="images/Week 2 images/w2i3.jpeg" alt="Headphones and googles for safety." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>I began my design using fusion 360. I started by making a sketch. I began making a rectangle that was 12.5 by 8..5, as that is the size of the wood. I began with making a border around the outside with filleted edges, so that finished product looked nice. Then I created  an outlined circle 3" in diameter, as I will be creating a cup that will fit into this space for next weeks assignment. Then I went about creating the rest of the spaces. I began with measuring my objects, my watercolors and brushes, and created spaces based on their sizes, with a little bit of extra room so I was certain each item would fit. The space for my watercolors ended up being 5.50 in by 2.75 in and the space for brushes was 9 in by 1 in. For the assignment I needed one more space, so I created a space 1.60 in by 1.40 in that can hold a sponge or paper towel to clean brushes when needed. </p>

    <p>After the design was sketched, I created a 3D model in fusion, as seen below. This was done using the sketch as a template and extruding pieces of the sketch from the wood, with a known thickness of 0.75 in. Then the design was colored a color that is close to the type of wood that was used in the final piece.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/Week 2 images/w" alt="Design sketch made in fusion 360." class="center" >
    <p>Next, the design was exported as a dxf file. Dxf files are no longer supported in illustrator so this file was converted into an illustrator file before being imported into adobe illustrator. </p>
    <p>Once in adobe illustrator, and size adjusted, the colors of the shapes were changed to fit the specific colors that the shaper uses. Additionally, here is where I added the word that I engraved into my piece. I chose to put the word create. Once the size and font was chosen, the letters were converted to outlines and color changed accordingly. </p>
    <p>Next I save my image as a svg file onto the shaper flash drive and plug the flashdrive into the shaper. Then I turn on the extension cord to bring power to the machine and I do a quick vacuum to insure no wood shavings are in the way. </p>
    <p>Now I prepare the piece of wood. Normally tape would be used to attach the piece of wood but there was no more tape left so I used four screws to hold down the board instead of two. To attach the screws, the 5/16 drill bit is first used to create guiding spots for the screws. Then the screws are screwed in with a phillips head. I vacuumed again to get rid of any dust.    </p>
    <p>Next I pick up the machine and place it onto the work station and turn it on. Next I scan the surface, making sure to include the shaper tape in view the whole time. Once the scan is complete, I can import my image into view and place it on top of my piece of wood. </p>
    <p>Then I changed my spindle* so that I can begin with engraving. For engraving, I engraved a depth of 0.02 in using an on line cut. Then I preformed a z touch, which must be preformed every time the spindle is changed or a new piece of wood is being used. Once it was calibrated, I was ready to cut.* </p>
    <p>After I engraved, I changed the spindle* to the uncut spindle for the rest of the cuts. I then cut out the three shapes using pocket cuts, each to a depth 0.25 in, following with an inside cut to make the edges neater. For the circular shape, I created an exterior cut, just cutting a circle and leaving the inside part as instructed.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I cut the edges. As I had to use four screws I had some difficultly with two screws almost in the path of the spindle. To remedy this, I screwed and unscrewed the screws as I went. The edges cut took three passes, at 0.25 in, 0.50 in, and 0.75. At the last depth, tabs were created. </p>
    <p>After finishing, I turned off the machine and vacuumed up the dust. I unscrewed the piece from the bench and cut the tabs off using a chisel and hammer. Finally I finished by sanding. </p>
    <p>*Changing the spindle. </p>
    <p>To change from one spindle to another, there are multiple steps that must be taken. Firstly, the machine must be off. Then the machine is unscrewed from one the right using a hex wrench and the finger guard removed. Then the spindle mount can be unplugged and lifted up and turned upside down. Then the spindle can be changed using a wrench while pressing the lock. When tightening the spindle into place, make sure the lock clicks to ensure that the spindle is securely in place. Everything is then put back into place.</p>
    <p>Two spindle bits were used in this project. A smaller v shaped spindle used for engraving and a larger upcut spindle used for everything else. </p>
    <p>*To cut</p>
    <p>For every cut, first the vacuum must be turned on and turned to manual. Then the spindle can be turned on and the green button on the rightcan be clicked to cut. To cut, you maneuver the machine, making sure to move fast enough to prevent burning. To abort, the red button is clicked on the left.</p>
