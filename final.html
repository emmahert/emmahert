    <p>For my final project, I decided to make a portable earring holder with earrings to go along with it. This is an idea I have been formulating for quite some time. I had wanted to make earrings with the laser cutter since I learned how to use the laser cutter last year and I am happy that now I will able to have the chance to do so. I also have been thinking about incorporating other machines and materials into the earring making proccess, for instance using the 3D printer to make earrings.</p>
    <p>The case is also something that I have been formalizing in my head for quite some time. This case would serve as a travel container for earrings, and potentally other items of jewelry (TBD). At home I have a earring stand that can hold earrings, but this is not functional for traveling. </p>
    <p>I began by sketching out my ideas on paper, as you can see below. Additionally, I looked online for earring design ideas, to see what is possible to create based on what others have already created. Here is where I can across iridescent acylic, which I am concidering for a material.</p>

    <p> Then I began to sketch the earring holder on fusion 360, however this design is subject to change.</p>

    <p>I also laser cut a piece of wood to test various sizes of holes.</p>

    I then printed out a test of a butterfly image that I designed on a Prusa using PLA. From this test, I have decided that FDM printing will likely work better for this print.
