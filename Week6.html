    <p>To begin this project I chose a template for a box with both a top and a hindge. The hidge is made using parametric kerfing. I downloaded the file and imported it into the glowforge software. Here I added my initals as well as a design to be engraved on the lid of my box.</p>

    <p>I then set up the printer, turning it on and attaching a QR tag to my piece of wood so that the printer knows what machine I am using and what settings to use. I then adjusted the machine to the new piece of wood and made sure to focus the camera on the part that I was cutting. I made sure that the sections that are to be engraved are on the correct settings as well as the parts to be cut. Then I was able to cut, making sure that the fan is on.</p>

   <p>After printing I was able to put all the pieces together. Since I had measured the thickness of my board prior to printing, the pieces fit together with no glue required.</p>
