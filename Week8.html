    <p>This project used multiple machines and techniques from previous weeks to create a project, an edge lit acylic</p>
    <p>To begin, the electronics were created. A desktop mill was used to create the circuit board.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/week 8 images/w8i1.jpeg" alt="Program used to use the desktop mill." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <img class="image" src="images/week 8 images/w8i2.jpeg" alt="Desktop mill." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>Next, the pieces were soldered together with a soldering iron. The pieces originally were connected one way, however wires were later added to make everything fit. These images are from my training, as the final electronic pieces were created for us.</p>

    <img class="image" src="images/week 8 images/w8i4.jpeg" alt="clamp holding circuit board in place." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>Then I designed the image to be cut onto the acylic. I first sketched out a design, then copying the design digitally using adobe fresco. I then sent the file from adobe fresco to adobe illustrator, converting the file into a vector file and adjusting the lines. A divit is on the bottom of the design to make sure the piece can fit into the final product.</p>

    <img class="image" src="images/week 8 images/w8i6.png" alt="acylic cut sketch on illustrator." class="center" width="50%" height="50%">
    <p>I then sent the design to the glowforge and cut it into the acylic.</p>

    <p>For some reason when the stems were printed, the areas where the lines crossed each other did not cut. I remidied this by using white out on the reverse side of the acylic. In the final piece it is not discerable from the front.</p>

    <p>Finally, I made a holder for the electronics parts and will hold the acylic upright. I used fusion 360 to create a box, making sure to add a place where it can be plugged in. I started to create the box by measuring the size of the electronics pieces, to make sure that they would fit inside. Then I created a sketch of a box to the aformentioned dimentions, adding extra distance on the edges to account for the thickness of the box. Then I made it into a cube and then hollowed it out with the shell tool. I then made a hole into the side by creating a sketch and making a hole. I then filleted the edges. The wooden pieces were printed for us, however, for the wooden piece on top, I reprinted the piece after the box was printed to ensure that it fit on top.</p>
