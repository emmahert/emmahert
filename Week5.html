    <p>I would consider vinyl cutting as digital fabrication. I see no reason that it would not be. You follow the same proccess as the previous weeks, creating a design online and transforming the digital design to a tangible 3D design via the use of a specific machine. The vinyl cutter might appear less technical than the 3D printers, as the files you use are more artistic and less technical, however that does not negate the fact that you follow the same proccess for both.</p>
    <p> To begin, I sketched an image using Adobe Fresco on my iPhone. This included the text that I drew myself. I then imported my drawing into Adobe Illustrator and converted my drawings into vector images. Then I made sure to arrage my image in the mannor I wanted before importing it into the software for the vinyl cutter.</p>
    <p>Here I ajusted my image to the correct size and moved it to the corner. I also made sure to invert my design so that it would appear on my t-shirt correctly. Then I set up my vinyl in the machine and adjusted the settings. Then I was ready to print.</p>

    <p>After printing, I seperated my design from the scraps and applied it to my t-shirt using heat.</p>
