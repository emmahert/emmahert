    <p> The first assignment for Intro to Digital Fabrication was to create a website (this website), which will host our assignments for the rest of the semester. This assignment was a but difficult for me, as I have never had any education on how to code, but I as went along I found that it was not as daunting as I had anticipated. </p>
    <p style="font-size:24px">Steps</p>
    <p> 1. First, I downloaded the text editor virtual studio code, the brackets extension for virtual studio code, and git, which was downloaded though terminal.  </p>
    <p> 2. Next I created account through GitHub.</p>
    <p> 3. For the next step, I ran into an error implementing the git repository onto my computer, which prevented me from being able to push changes. There appeared to be a copy within a copy preventing it from running correctly. This was corrected by deleting the copy within the copy and some aid from others. </p>

    <p> 4. After I fixed this error, I was able to make changes to my repository and push the changes.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/week 1 images/w1i3.png" alt="Hello word." class="center">
    <p> (Yes, I am aware that this says “Hello Word,” I am not the best at spelling.)</p>
    <p> 5. For the formatting, I began with a template from W3 schools, however I adapted much of it for my website, using it more as a guide for what I needed, as I have never created a website before. For many of the elements of my website, I had to look up what the correct terminology was to use, with help from others. </p>
    <p style="font-size:24px">Elements of my site</p>
    <p> The basis of any change follows the following steps, first to change the element on the file, then to save and commit the change, and finally to push the change.</p>
    <p>Images: The following line is for the image at the top of the page. When I first tried to upload photos it did not work, but I eventually was able to once I linked the image to its location on virtual studio code.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/week 1 images/w1i4.png" alt="Line of code for an image." class="center">
    <p>Connecting pages: To go from one page to another, the page must be linked. This line is for a box to click to go to a new page.</p>
    <img class="image" src="images/week 1 images/w1i5.png" alt="Line of code for connecting pages." class="center">
    <p>Page styling: There are some page styling I have implemented for the whole page, in particular for centering the images on the page and changing the font, as of now. </p>
    <img class="image" src="images/week 1 images/w1i6.png" alt="Line of code for page styling." class="center">
    <p>Finally, I wrote up the post of this week and organized everything before posting into virtual studio code.</p>
