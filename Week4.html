    <p>What is SLA printing?</p>
    <p>I chose to do a spinning ring for this project. The pros were that spinning rings are cool (I own one myself). The con was that the two layers are close together and might be too close for the printer to print the sections seperately, resulting in a non-spinning spinning ring.</p>
    <P>To acomplish the creation of this ring I had to use a variety of tools on fusion 360. First I began by drawing the design of the ring of the sketch. The part of the ring that I drew is the part of the ring that seperates the two parts of the ring, with a small divit connecting the two pieces. I used the line function to sketch the lines.</P>

    <p>Next I used the revolve function to create the ring shape. This took the sketch I made and transformed it into a 3D donut shape. Then I used inspect, section analysis to bisect the shape I created.</p>

    <p>From here I rounded out the edges between the two sections of the ring using the fllet tool. Additionally, here I filleted the edges of the ring.</p>

    <p> Finally, I added a design to the outside of the ring. To do this, I created a plane on the edge of the ring and typed my design into a text box on this layer. I decided to go with a design of repeating stars. Then I used the emboss tool to deboss my design on the surface of the</p>

    <p>However, once the ring was printed, I noticed my design had two problems with it. Firstly, I noticed that my pattern did not appear well on the surface of the ring, as I did not deboss deap enough. Next time I design something I would make sure to deboss deaper in order to get the desired effect. Additionally, the ring did not turn out a spinning one. This was an issue with most of the spinning rings, as the distance between the layers was too close.</p>
